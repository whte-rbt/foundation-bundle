WhteRbtFoundationBundle
=======================

The WhteRbtFoundationBundle is just a small toolkit for my personal Symfony
applications and bundles. It provides a bunch of classes, interfaces and twig
templates as a starting point for projects.

The bundle is not stable, things MAY and WILL change. It is not designated to be
used by the public. Feel free to do, but don't blame me for any problems... ;)

Documentation
-------------

I will add some documentation soon. Please check out the inline documentation
until then.

----------

The bundle uses semantic versioning. Please see
